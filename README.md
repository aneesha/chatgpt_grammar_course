## Introduction to Grammar

Grammar is the set of rules that govern the way words are used in a language. It is an essential part of effective communication, as it allows us to construct clear and coherent sentences that convey our thoughts and ideas accurately. 

One of the most common errors that students make is subject-verb agreement. This occurs when the subject and verb of a sentence do not match in number, such as "The cat *is* sleeping" versus "The cats *are* sleeping." Another common error is the misuse of punctuation, such as confusing a semicolon with a colon or using a comma splice.

### Quiz 1:
What is the function of grammar in effective communication?

- [( )] It helps us to speak more clearly
- [(X)] It allows us to construct clear and coherent sentences
- [( )] It helps us to spell words correctly

### Quiz 2:
What is an example of subject-verb agreement error?

- [( )] The cat *sleeping*
- [(X)] The cat *is* sleeping
- [( )] The cat *sleep*

### Quiz 3:
What is an example of a punctuation error?

- [(X)] Confusing a semicolon with a colon
- [( )] Using a period instead of a question mark
- [( )] Using a exclamation mark instead of a comma


## Nouns

A noun is a word used to name a person, place, thing, or idea. In English, nouns can be singular or plural, and they can also be in possessive form. One of the most common errors that students make is confusing singular and plural forms, such as "The cat *is* sleeping" versus "The cats *are* sleeping." Another common error is the misuse of the possessive form, such as "The cat's *tail* is fluffy" versus "The cat *tail's* is fluffy."

It's also common for students to confuse common nouns and proper nouns. Common nouns refer to general names, such as "book" or "city", while proper nouns refer to specific names, such as "Harry Potter" or "New York City".

### Quiz 1:
What is the difference between singular and plural nouns?

- [(X)] Singular nouns refer to one thing, while plural nouns refer to more than one thing
- [( )] Singular nouns are used for people and plural nouns are used for things
- [( )] Singular nouns are used for small things and plural nouns are used for big things

### Quiz 2:
What is an example of a mistake in the possessive form of a noun?

- [( )] The cat's *tail* is fluffy
- [(X)] The cat *tail's* is fluffy
- [( )] The cat's tail *fluffy*

### Quiz 3:
What is the difference between common and proper nouns?

- [(X)] Common nouns refer to general names, while proper nouns refer to specific names
- [( )] Common nouns are used in the beginning of a sentence, while proper nouns are used in the end of a sentence
- [( )] Common nouns are capitalized, while proper nouns are not.


## Verbs

A verb is a word that expresses an action, state, or occurrence. In English, verbs have different forms depending on the tense, voice, and mood. One of the most common errors that students make is subject-verb agreement, such as "The cat *is* sleeping" versus "The cats *are* sleeping." Another common error is the misuse of irregular verbs, such as "I *swim* yesterday" instead of "I *swam* yesterday."

It's also common for students to confuse the different tenses, such as past, present, and future. For example, "I *am* studying" is in the present tense, "I *studied* yesterday" is in the past tense, and "I *will study* tomorrow" is in the future tense.

### Quiz 1:
What are the different forms of verbs in English?

- [(X)] Tense, voice, and mood
- [( )] Singular and plural forms
- [( )] Possessive forms

### Quiz 2:
What is an example of a mistake in subject-verb agreement?

- [(X)] The cat *is* sleeping
- [( )] The cat *sleep*
- [( )] The cats *is* sleeping

### Quiz 3:
What is the difference between past, present, and future tenses?

- [(X)] The past refers to a completed action, the present refers to an ongoing action, and the future refers to an action that will happen
- [( )] The past is used for people, present is used for things, and future is used for ideas
- [( )] The past is used for the beginning of a sentence, present is used in the middle and future is used in the end of a sentence.


## Pronouns

A pronoun is a word that is used in place of a noun or noun phrase. In English, pronouns have different forms depending on their function in a sentence, such as subject or object. One of the most common errors that students make is pronoun-antecedent agreement, such as "Everyone *brought* their own lunch" versus "Everyone *brought* his or her own lunch." Another common error is the misuse of pronoun case, such as "Me and my friends *went* to the mall" instead of "My friends and I *went* to the mall."

It's also common for students to confuse relative pronouns, such as "who" and "whom". "Who" is used as the subject of a clause, as in "The person who *is* speaking is my teacher", and "whom" is used as the object of a clause, as in "The person whom *I am* talking to is my teacher".

### Quiz 1:
What are the different forms of pronouns in English?

- [(X)] Subject and object forms
- [( )] Singular and plural forms
- [( )] Possessive forms

### Quiz 2:
What is an example of a mistake in pronoun-antecedent agreement?

- [(X)] Everyone *brought* their own lunch
- [( )] Everyone *brought* his or her own lunch
- [( )] Everyone *bring* his or her own lunch

### Quiz 3:
What is the difference between "who" and "whom"?

- [(X)] "Who" is used as the subject of a clause, "whom" is used as the object of a clause
- [( )] "Who" is used for people and "whom" is used for things
- [( )] "Who" is used for the beginning of a sentence, "whom" is used in the middle.


## Adjectives and Adverbs

An adjective is a word that describes a noun or pronoun, while an adverb is a word that describes a verb, adjective, or other adverb. One of the most common errors that students make is adjective-adverb confusion, such as "She sings *beautiful*" instead of "She sings *beautifully*." Another common error is the placement of adjectives and adverbs in a sentence, such as "She *beautiful* sings" instead of "She sings *beautifully*."

It's also common for students to confuse comparatives and superlatives. Comparatives are used to compare two things, as in "She sings *better* than her sister" and superlatives are used to compare three or more things, as in "She sings *best* in her class".

### Quiz 1:
What is the difference between adjectives and adverbs?

- [(X)] Adjectives describe nouns or pronouns, adverbs describe verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs
- [( )] Adjectives are used for people, adverbs are used for things
- [( )] Adjectives are used for the beginning of a sentence, adverbs are used in the middle

### Quiz 2:
What is an example of adjective-adverb confusion?

- [(X)] She sings *beautiful*
- [( )] She sings *beautifully*
- [( )] She sings *beautifulness*

### Quiz 3:
What is the difference between comparatives and superlatives?

- [(X)] Comparatives are used to compare two things, superlatives are used to compare three or more things
- [( )] Comparatives are used for people, superlatives are used for things
- [( )] Comparatives are used for the beginning of a sentence, superlatives are used in the middle.


## Prepositions and Conjunctions

A preposition is a word that shows the relationship between a noun or pronoun and other words in a sentence, such as "She is sitting *on* the chair." A conjunction is a word that connects words, phrases, or clauses, such as "She is sitting *on* the chair *and* reading a book." One of the most common errors that students make is misusing prepositions, such as "She is sitting *in* the chair" instead of "She is sitting *on* the chair." Another common error is run-on sentences, which occur when two independent clauses are joined together without a conjunction or punctuation, such as "She is sitting on the chair reading a book."

It's also common for students to confuse coordinating conjunctions and subordinating conjunctions. Coordinating conjunctions are used to join independent clauses, such as "She is sitting on the chair, *and* she is reading a book." Subordinating conjunctions are used to connect clauses of different syntactic type, such as "She is sitting on the chair *because* she is reading a book."

### Quiz 1:
What is the difference between prepositions and conjunctions?

- [(X)] Prepositions show the relationship between a noun or pronoun and other words in a sentence, conjunctions connect words, phrases, or clauses
- [( )] Prepositions are used for people, conjunctions are used for things
- [( )] Prepositions are used for the beginning of a sentence, conjunctions are used in the middle

Here are some tips and strategies for teaching the module via a virtual zoom session:

Break up the content into chunks: Instead of delivering a lecture that covers all the grammar topics in one go, break up the content into smaller chunks that are easy for students to understand and retain.

Use a variety of teaching methods: Use a mix of visual aids, interactive activities, and hands-on exercises to keep students engaged.

Encourage participation: Ask questions and encourage students to participate in class discussions, quizzes, and other interactive activities.

Provide immediate feedback: Give students immediate feedback on their work to help them understand where they need to improve.

Use collaborative activities: Encourage students to work together in small groups or pairs to complete activities, such as creating a sentence using a specific grammar rule or correcting sentences with errors.

Here are a few collaborative activities you can give to students in the session:

Sentence Scramble: Divide the class into small groups and give each group a set of words. Ask them to form grammatically correct sentences using the words.

Grammar Treasure Hunt: Divide the class into small groups and give them a list of grammar rules to find in a text. Ask them to highlight the examples and explain how they used the rule.

Error Correction: Divide the class into small groups and give them a set of sentences with errors. Ask them to find and correct the errors, and explain why the correction is correct.
